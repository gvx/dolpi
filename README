Dol Pi is a constructed language, which emphasizes on being as natural as
possible.

It takes some inspiration from my previous constructed language, Mèkùbi,
although that was more focused on being rational and logical, while Dol Pi is
more about emotions and feelings.

The git repo includes a source file (src.ecsv), which is written in an extended
comma separated value list. The definitions for the translations in each
language (Dol Pi, Dutch, English and Norwegian) are separated by semi-colons
(;) and the different translations for one language are separated by commas.

The source file can be "compiled" to six different dictionaries in a number of
formats. For this purpose, builddicts.py is included in the distribution. For
those who can't (or don't want to) run Python scripts: on GitHub are all the
dictionaries for all languages in all formats available for every major release
of the language.

A grammatical guide is not included in this README. The guide is written in
Lout and can be found in guide.lt. A PDF version is distributed with every
major release.
